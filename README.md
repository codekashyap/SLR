# Simple Linear Regression.
This is a simple linear regression model that is built on using statsmodels package.
This is a model to show the causal relationship between price and and size of the real estate.
Here, price of the real estate is the target and size is the feature.
We use 'real_estate_price_size.csv' as dataset file.

## Following process is perform to reach the final conclusion.

1.Import the relevant libraries,that we use like matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, pandas and statsmodels.api.

2.Load the data set.

3.Declare the dependent and the independent variables.

4.Plot the graph using scatter plot.

5.Use statsmodels to get regression model and OLS (ordinary least square) to estimate the linear regression equation.

6.Plot regression line.


## We can also analysis the OLS regression table to get :
- Model summary.
- Coefficient table.
- Info related additional test.
